# Legislature and Procedures for the Ohio State University

This Git repository serves as the central hub for all legislature regarding OSC@tOSU.
Primarily, this means the constitution, but it will also include recommendations for
each of the roles heald by members of the Executive Board (or E-Board) to accomplish
their job effectively.

All of the documents regarding club legislature are written in markdown, a text file
format that is easy to read as-is, but can be rendered by most document readers. GitHub,
for example, automatically renders markdown files. Additionally, the documents herein
can be compiled with the [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), so as to create
a fluid reading experience.
