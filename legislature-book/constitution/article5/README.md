Advisors of student organizations must be full-time members of the University faculty or

to the Constitution, Goals, or other legislature of the organization. They are
additionally expected to approve programming and meeting decisions, as well as budgeting
decisions. Advisors are expected to meet with the officers of the organization at least
once per term.

Finally, advisors are encouraged to meet with the officers on a more regular basis, such
as once per month, as well as give general opinions and advice pertaining to the success
