# Article IV: Executive Officership

## Section II: Voting and Tenure

Elections are to be held annually as per the procedures provided herein.

All voting procedures occur within a time frame defined by the first weekend after the
last day of proper classes (i.e. not finals). For brevity, we refer to this weekend
as the Post-class Weekend. All events and time periods that are defined to start some
"weeks" before this Weekend are implied to have thresholds at Sunday, 11:59 PM.

### Chapter I: Time Alotted to Self-Nomination and Voting

7 weeks exactly before the Post-class Weekend, a three-week period of self-nomination
will open. No less than one week before this period, current Executive leadership will
have notified active members at large of the upcoming self-nomination period. Current
Executive leadership is to prepare a manner in which members can self-nominate for all
Executive roles and potential new ones, should they feel that there is a set of responsibilities
warranting their own dedicated role, and that they are qualified to fulfill them. Whatever
manner of self-nomination is selected must also include a way for self-nominees to justify
their candidacy for the role (be it past experience, relevant skills, etc.) so that voters
are better prepared to gauge the available candidates. An active member is permitted to
self-nominate for more than one Executive position, but is only permitted to hold one Executive
position during their tenure. Candidates are to disclose Executive position preference
as a part of their self-nomination. Self-nomination is to close 4 weeks before the Post-class
Weekend.

As soon as active members are notified of the candidates, candidates are free to campaign
for their positions, so long as their campaigning is congruent with the expected behaviors
of an OSC member in good standing. 3 weeks before the Post-class Weekend, a three-week
period of voting will open that ends on the threshold of the Post-class Weekend. 

No later than 2 weeks after the Post-class Weekend, current Executive leadership is to
announce the results of the election. 

### Chapter II: Precise Voting and Vote-Counting Procedure

When the voting time period has opened, voting is to be completed using rank-choice for
each Executive role. All candidates for a given role are to be listed, and voters are
to list them in order of preference.

In counting these votes, the first candidate to reach 50% first-rank approval is awarded
the position. If no candidate receives 50% first-rank approval, the candidate with the
least first-rank approvals is eliminated from the count, and the votes allotted to them
are divided among the next-highest-ranked candidate for each voter. First-rank approval
is recalculated in this manner until a candidate receives 50% of the votes.

If a single candidate is awarded multiple Executive positions, their highest-preferred
role is awarded to them. For the role(s) they were not awarded, the votes are recounted
with all candidates back in the pool, but with the candidate in question removed. The winner
of the role is decided by the preceding process once again.

This process is to repeat itself until all candidate-available roles are filled by unique
candidates.

### Chapter III: Tenure

The winning candidates are appointed to their roles on the first day of the August
immediately succeeding the election period. Current Executive leadership is expected to
facilitate the adoption of Executive responsibilities justly and amicably during the
period in which the new Executive leaders have been announced but not yet appointed. These
candidates hold their roles until the candidates awarded Executive positions in the next
annual election cycle are appointed. That is, Executive officership is granted for one
year, from August 1st to August 1st.

Members of OSC are permitted to run for Executive Officership so long as they meet
the requirements of an active member as provided in
