# Article IV: Executive Officership

## Section I: Titles and Responsibilities

Any role not marked with an \*asterisk is considered supplementary, and its being unfulfilled
during an academic term is acceptable. In such an event, the available executive officership
will take on the stated responsibilities at their discretion. As a default, any role not
fulfilled will have their associated responsibilities taken on by the President and Vice
President as appropriate.

All Executive roles will have alternative titles that are to be recognized by past leadership
and advisors as valid. They exist so as to allow flexibility in how members of the Executive
Board of OSC represent their Officership to others, be that in professional documents, in
communicating with non-OSC parties, or otherwise.

some of these responsibilities are better handled by members of the Executive board different
from the one to whom they are described to belong in this Section. As a rule of thumb,
shifting of responsibilities is acceptable so long as the stated general-purpose role of
the officer(s) in question is neither infringed upon nor ignored, and so long as all
officers in their roles feel they have a set of responsibilities representative of the
workload suggested by the responsibilities provided herein.
