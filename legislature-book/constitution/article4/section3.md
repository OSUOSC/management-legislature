# Article IV: Executive Officership

## Section III: Modifying Officer Positions

As expressed in [Section I](/constitution/article4/section1.html) of this Article, this organization
must always have unique individuals fulfilling the following roles:

- President
- Treasurer

In the case of substantial changes to organization membership, current Officers may deem it
reasonable to create new Officer positions, or eliminate existing ones. When this occurs
is left entirely to Officer discretion, with the details surrounding procedure of accepting
changes to Executive Officership being left to current Executive Officers upon which to decide. 

In the event of an added role, the role in question is to be logged in the Office of Student
Life portal as a "Secretary." The precise name is left to current Executive Officership to
decide upon, and is to be entered in the field designated "Other Title." The only
exception to this rule is for the additional role of Vice President, which should be
labeled in the system as such. Historically, the naming convention has been as follows,
where one is selected as the "primary" title, and others are usable by members who hold
the role, as expressed in [Article IV, Section I:](/constitution/article4/section1.html)

- Director of [RESPONSIBILITY]
- Vice President of [RESPONSIBILITY]
- [RESPONSIBILITY] Lead
- [RESPONSIBILITY] Czar
- Secretary of [RESPONSIBILITY]

These are suggestions, and they can be eschewed in favor of a title agreed upon by current 
Executive Officership, including the active member who would be adopting the role. Any
changes made to Executive Officership must be made public to membership prior to the role
changes taking effect.
