# Article III: Procedures for Removing Members and Executive Officers

It may be the case that a member of the organization, be they passive, active, or an
executive officer, has their behavior deemed incongruent with the stated goals of the
organization, in violation of the Ohio State University Standards, the Student Code
of Conduct, and/or the Non-Discrimination Policy as expressed in
[Article I, Section III](/constitution/article1/section3.html), or otherwise deemed
unacceptable by the expectations of this organizations and its membership. For these
regrettable cases, and in the interest of fostering a productive, accessible, and
equitable community for the OSU community at large, a procedure for removing the offending
organization member is defined.

In calculating a non-unanimities (i.e. majorities or pluralities), abstentions from active
members are ignored. In calculating a unanimity, abstentions are equivalent to nays.

Members removed from the organization through the procedures forthcoming lose their status
of good standing for two academic years.
