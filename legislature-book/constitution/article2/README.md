# Article II: Membership

In the pursuit of our stated purpose, membership in this student organization is extended
to all members of the OSU and Columbus community who wish to involve themselves - and
learn how to benefit from - open source. No fees or dues will ever be collected from any member
of the community wishing to involve themselves in the Open Source Club.

Recognizing the breadth of our potential member pool, we define the two types of members
as **active** and **passive**, and elaborate on the priviledges afforded to each.
