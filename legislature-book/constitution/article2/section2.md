# Article II: Membership

## Section II: Passive Membership

Passive membership is awarded to any and all individuals who are in good standing
with the organization, and who display interest in the organization to a recognizable
degree. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Those who subscribe to any existing mailing lists.
- Those who interact with any existing social media accounts.
- Those who are members of any existing social groups (Discord, Revolt, Matrix, etc.)
- Those who have expressed explicit interest in the club, but are unable to consistently
  interface with it due to personal constraints.
- Other examples left to the officers' discretion.

Passive membership affords members the privelege of continuing to participate in digital
social groups; being allowed to attend meetings and, to the discretion of associated
organizations, meeting collaborations.
