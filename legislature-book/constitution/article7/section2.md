# Article VII: Management of Organization Assets

## Section II: Digital Assets

In addition to other assets that are typically held by OSU organizations, the Open Source
Club will also manage a GitHub organization.

At any given time, the only individuals who are permitted write access to the GitHub
organization and all repositories over which it presides are the three primary officers labeled
in Article IV Section III, the faculty advisor(s) of the organization, and any other additional
officers whose explicitly-named duties in this constitution include the management of this
organization's digital assets. It is the responsibility of those aforementioned to ensure
that, when the individuals taking on these roles are changed, permissions are revoked and
granted properly within one month of the decision for these roles to be changed.

Non-write access is left to the current officers' discretion.
