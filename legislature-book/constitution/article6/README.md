# Article VI: Organization Meetings

While meeting attendance is not explicitly required to be a member of this organization (excepting
active membership), it is highly encouraged. In-person meetings shall occur no less
than two times in a semester, pending extenuating public health considerations, individual, communal,
municipal, or otherwise.

It is a stated goal of the OSC to perform collaborative meetings with other organizations.
Whether and which of these meetings are considered official OSC meetings is left to the
discretion of the current officers.
