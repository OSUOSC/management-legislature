The Open Source Club at The Ohio State University has had an extensive role in OSU's tech-related
student life, from sprouting into other clubs and events, to encouraging students and alumni alike
to become a part of the open source community.

The current leadership of this organization would like to extend gratitude to former members and staff;
open source has had a rich history, both in and out of OSU's campus, and it is with the support of those
who have come before us that we are able to exercise this passion so freely.

The current staff of the Open Source Club would like to acknowledge the following past members and staff for their contributions:

- Isaac Jones
- Martin Jansche
- Michael Benedict
- Andrew Cziryak
- Kyle Rosenberg
- Adrian Vovk
- Dominik Winecki
