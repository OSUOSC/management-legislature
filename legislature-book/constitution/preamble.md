# Preamble

The Open Source Club at The Ohio State University has had an extensive role in OSU's tech-related
student life, from sprouting into other clubs and events, to encouraging students and alumni alike
to become a part of the open source community.

The current leadership of this organization would like to extend gratitude to former members and staff;
open source has had a rich history, both in and out of OSU's campus, and it is with the support of those
who have come before us that we are able to exercise this passion so freely.

A detailed record of past leadership for the Open Source Club at the Ohio State University
is included in the complete legislature for the organization.
